# Natural-Language-Processing-with-Disaster-Tweets

In times of disaster, Twitter has become a crucial communication route.
Because cellphones are so widely available, users may report an emergency in real time. As a result, more agencies are interested in monitoring Twitter programmatically (i.e. disaster relief organisations and news agencies).

In this competition, you must create a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about actual disasters and which aren't. You'll get access to a dataset of 10,000 hand-classified tweets.Â
